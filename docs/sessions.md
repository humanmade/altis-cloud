# Sessions

Altis includes support for PHP sessions using Redis as the storage backend. In order to activate PHP sessions support you need to
have Redis activated as well, e.g.:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "altis": {
            "modules": {
                "cloud": {
                    "redis": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** The cookie name is `altis_session`, rather than the default `PHPSESSID` in order to bypass CloudFront page caching.
