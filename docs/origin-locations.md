# Origin Locations

Altis projects are primarily served from any one of our Origin locations. This is the data-center that is responsible for generating application requests for un-cached pages, logged in user requests and requests to the admin interface. See [page caching](./page-caching.md) for details on page cache rules.

When creating your Altis Cloud project, we will discuss the best origin location for requirements. An origin that is in your legal jurisdiction, or closest to your editorial team (for minimum latency) is often the best choice.

We provide the following Origin locations:

**North America**

- North Virginia

**Europe**

- Ireland
- London
- Frankfurt

**Asia Pacific**

- Singapore
- Tokyo
- Sydney

We are always iterating on our global availability, and other regions may become available. Contact us to discuss other options.
