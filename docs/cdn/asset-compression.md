# Asset Compression Strategy

### What and why compress assets?

For faster load speeds of your page, static assets are compressed at the server, and then uncompressed by a vistor's browser. This is a contributing factor to SEO scores, but generally good practice to help reduce overall bandwidth usage. 

Those static assets include .js and CSS files, images, and also the generated HTML files of your site.

### How do we compress assets?

Assets are compressed using GZIP and is done via NGINX. When theyâ€™re sent as a response to a request that asset will also be cached at the CDN for faster delivery of that assets to subsequent requests.

The [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) we compress are listed below.

`text/plain, text/css, text/html, application/json, application/javascript, application/x-javascript, text/xml, application/xml, application/xml+rss, text/javascript, application/x-font-ttf, font/opentype, application/vnd.ms-fontobject, image/svg+xml`

Images are compressed and cached separately, as we leverage [Dynamic Image Resizing](https://docs.altis-dxp.com/media/dynamic-images/), the Images are created on the fly, and then cached at the CDN layer for serving the image. Images will attempt to be served via `[WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)` format if the browser supports WebP, images will be served in that format, falling back to the image default format.

### What about Brotli compression?

It can provide a meaningful boost to compression for non-image assets like javascript or CSS. Brotli compression is only partially supported, meaning it can only be used on-the-fly by at the CDN, and not for `text/html` MIME Types and [not all browsers support Brotli](https://docs.w3cub.com/browser_support_tables/brotli).

Brotli support on Altis is currently available on an opt-in basis. To enable Brotli on your application, contact [Altis Support](https://docs.altis-dxp.com/guides/getting-help-with-altis/).
